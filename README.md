# Qt powered Dashboard for turtle-bot relocalization
- - - 

_this was something i chose make out of blue for no specific reason and I had to make a qt assignment.
thinking back i believe it might have made more sense to make one for mapping using cartographer. But since I had already started working on this.. I guess no options... It took me about 5 hrs to make this and another 4 to document it and re-format the code_

### Basic Idea:
Your robot is in an known space, of which you already have a map. The robot moves around the map avoiding obstacles trying to predict it's own location based on the current sensor readings and previously recorded map.

### Pre-requisites:
- ROS2-Humble
- linux
- pyQt
- python
- c++
- bash
